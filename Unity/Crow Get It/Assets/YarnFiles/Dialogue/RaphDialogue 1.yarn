    Raph: People don’t usually find this cave, how'd you get in?

        -> From the river...
        -> I just kinda wandered in.

    Raph: Oh, well it's nice to have some company!
    Player: Do you need anything?
    Raph: Company and help! This is new for me. I'm really hungry but I haven’t seen any FIREFLIES recently. 
    Raph: They used to hang around down here but I think I scared them away higher in the cave...
    Raph: You think you could get some for me?

    -> Of course!
